*Welcome to my GitHub profile.*

My name is Dawid Jaguszewski, and I am senior marketing student at Northern Illinois University.

### Background

I am a first generation college student. My parents immigrated from Poland and I am very proud of my Polish Heritage

Before coming to NIU, I attended McHenry County Community College where I graduated with my associates in arts with high honors. During my time at MCC I was also a member of Phi Thetta Kappa Honor Society

When I'm not working or at school I enjoy spending time with family and friends. I enjoy traveling to new places and hiking in forests and mountian ranges. This upcoming spring I plan on hiking through the grand canyon. I hope you enjoy my profile!
